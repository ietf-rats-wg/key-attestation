DICE keys are derived from environmental attributes, but once an identifier is generated, it doesn't NEED to be nested for it to make sense. \nHaving globally unique identfiers for environments means you don't depend on nesting (local name space scoping) contexts for disambiguation. A flat list of tuples : (environment identifier, attribute value) offers sufficient disambiguation if _environment identifier_ is globally unique. \n\nI'm not asking you to go look, but if you don't believe me you can look at the internal representation of claims in the corim draft which is modeled as a flat list of claims.\n\nGiven attestation pretty much requires attestation keys to assert claims, keys can be a reasonable instance specific identifiers for environments. This is what a device cert is doing already. It's often helpful to have a class specific identifier for cases where an attribute applies to multiple devices/environments at the same time (such as a model or versioned thing). If the class identifiers are also globally unique, then they don't depend on nesting for disambiguation. A key can also be a class identifier if it is a group key. \n\nHSMs are not different from other embedded computing environments in that they have both class-based and instance-based objects for which it makes sense to produce attested claims that describes them. If I have a preference, it is that the objects be identified with globally unique identifiers to minimize the need for composite nested identifiers. ",

But we need to take into account CKA_SENSITIVE too. For example a key with CKA_EXTRACTABLE=false, CKA_SENSITIVE=false could be read out of an HSM simply by calling C_GetAttributeValue. \n\nSo I think we need to define the property here a bit differently. For attestation purposes you mostly want to know if the key cannot be extracted from the HSM in any form (i.e. wrapped or plaintext).\n\n(I guess someone might be interested in \"can be wrapped but no plaintext export\" but that opens a rather large can of worms about what key(s) and mechanism(s) can be used to wrap it. Let's not.)\n\nMikeO: For now I'll just add an EDNOTE for future design team discussion.",

However, more complex HSM devices require a more complex key attestation format that encompasses the mutability of these attributes.\n\n> \"Often, a TPM will host cryptographic keys for both the kernel and userspace of a local operating system, but a Presenter may only represent a single user or application.\"\n\nThese references could safely be dropped, as this specification is targeting HSMs, not TPMs.\n\n(Also, \"'extractable' may always be true\" seems to disagree with \"the devices are not capable of key export\", which itself is unclear because I believe the TPM _can_ export certain keys.)",

When producing the PKIX evidence, the HSM repeats the nonce that was provided as part of the request.\n> \n> When providing a nonce, a Presenter includes, in the attestation request, an entity of type `id-pkix-evidence-entity-transaction` with an attribute of type `id-pkix-evidence-attribute-transaction-nonce`.

      "body": "Greetings!\n\nI had offered to review https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-pkix-key-attestation/ at the last meeting and I apologize for my delay in just doing that now!\n\nThe current version looks very good. However, I recommend writing the abstract over as it is disconnected from the content of the draft. I read the draft as enabling and describing how you can attest an HSM and the environment where keys are stored. It uses FIPS 140-3 or Common Criteria validation criteria in order to develop the list of what will be checked.\n\nIs the introduction correct in terms of the high-level aims or is the draft more tactical to HSM verification using attestation? The CA Browser forum example extends the examples to key stores, so perhaps that overall goal is this broad, but I wanted to check as consistency in the abstract, introduction, and body of the document would be very helpful as it's a complex enough topic already. :-)\n\nA few questions/nits/comments:\n\nIn section 5.1.6, there is a note that someone does not understand the subsection and I can see why. The third paragraph is where the language adds to confusion and should be easy enough to fix. This sentence is confusing as written:\n\"Note that by including envid as a platform attribute, this implies\n   that it applies to all attested key entities.\"\nShould it be \"all attested entities\"?  I would think it applies to the attested entity, the platform where the envid is included as an attribute, but not all or you'll need to explain what you mean by all. I think the other sentences are ok.\n\nSection 5.3.2\n\nI think the paragraph cautioning on timestamps is appropriately placed. You might add a quick sentence about it in the security considerations section as well.\n\n\nSection 8.2\n\nPlease expand out KAT and PAT\n\nI hope this review is helpful!\n\n--\n\nBest regards,\nKathleen",

Replaced with \"Verifier\"\r\n\r\n- Moved discussion around including a request ClaimDescriptionTbs within a signed PkixEvidence from sec-cons-privacy to sec-cons-auth-the-presenter so it can be referred to from both sec-cons-privacy and sec-reqs.",
